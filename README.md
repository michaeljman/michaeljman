### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Michael Jackaman*,

Here is a little bit of information about me.


 ### 1. Previous coding experience, if any...

I took the intro Compsi class last year so I have a solid base for knowing how to code. 

  ### 2. Reason for taking this class...

I am taking this class because I really liked Compsi 1 last year, and may be considereing computer science for a career path.

 ### 3. Other interests...

I am very much a math and science brained person, so I am taking two math classes and another science. I also like action movies.

 ### 4. Goals you have for this class and/or projects you'd like to complete...
 
I would like to leave the class with the tools to do anything I would need in the workplace computer science wise. 

 ### 5. What are worries or fears you have about this class...
 
I am at the AP level so my biggest fear would be adjusting to the tempo of the class.
